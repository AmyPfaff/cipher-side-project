# cipher-side-project
CLI Cipher Project  
This is a small Java side project that allows a user to encode a message using a shift cipher. The user chooses the offset number, and each letter is shifted in the alphabet by that number. The encoded message is printed in the console.
After a message is encoded, the user has the option to encode another or exit. If the user chooses to do another message, they have the option to change the offset or keep it the same.
